This is an app i made which was ordered by a club in London.
I was able to get this opportunity because my brother is an employee there.
The program uses the camera to take pictures of documents and sends them to a database on a server,
if internet is unavailable the program stores the pictures on a local database on the smartphone.
When internet is avalable the stored photos can be sent to the server. I have added the .apk file to this repository
